# Purpose of repository

### The project is pointed to people who want to learn something new and hone their own developer skills.

We're going to leverage:

- Java knowledge

- design patterns

- enhance testing skills

- develop skills to work with a team, especially with git-tool


What we'll do during this project

- implementation few fancy algorithms

    - Cesar [go there][cesar_page]

    - ROT-13 [go there][rot13_page]

    - Vigenere [take me there][vigenere_page]

    - Matrix [let's go][matrix_page]

    - AtBash [nice, WTF?][AtBash_page]

- introduce design patterns, exp:

    - singleton

    - strategy 

- simple window do manage our ciphers and makes it more useful for an operator

## ___This guideline will be updated every day during the whole learning block according to contestants' progress___

## Game rule

1. Everyone makes a fork of this repository
    - you have to make a new branch and  name of it is your name
    - this is simple way to follow your progress

2. You make own implementation of a given task

3. Every algorithm has necessary test methods

4. After implementation make push request to _master_ to due check result by teacher 



# Happy coding !!!
